# RESTfulUserApplication

This is a bundle of RESTful API's that I made with Java Spring Boot. I used Postman to test the RESTful Service and added several add-ons like Swagger documentation, internationalization, HATEOAS and dynamic filtering. 

The main RESTful API here is a User management web service. Where you can add users and delete/get them. Content validation is implemented on the users as well so that the input can get verified before added.
